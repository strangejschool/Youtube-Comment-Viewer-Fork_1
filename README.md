# Youtube Comment Viewer
Some filters may block you from viewing Youtube comments but alas you can now view them.

## Setup
To use the Youtube Comment Viewer (YCV) you simply need to download the files, then either host them on a free server, your own computer, or any other server hosting methods.

## Usage
Using the YCV is extremley simple
1. Go to the location URL where the site is being hosted
2. Enter the URL of the Youtube video's comments you want to view
3. Press "view"
It's as easy as that!
